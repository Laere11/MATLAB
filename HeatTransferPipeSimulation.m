% HeatTransferPipeSimulation.m
% This script simulates the temperature distribution along a pipe containing 
% liquid methane fuel, with a portion of the pipe subjected to cryogenic cooling.
% The cooling is modeled as a convective heat loss term applied in the cooled region.
% The simulation uses a finite difference method to solve the steady-state heat conduction
% equation. A parameter study is included to see how pipe diameter and length affect
% the temperature gradient.
